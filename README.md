Miss, I decided to find the simplest way to make a game without any complicated parts such as the illustrations
I also tried finding ways to implement a winning condition for Hangman but what I mostly found were Python programs and while there are some for C#, 
they were for other games such as tic-tac-toe so my submission is somehow underwhelming
